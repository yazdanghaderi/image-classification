In this collection, an example of classification between dogs and cats from scratch is presented. 
The procedure is that first the corrupted images are removed from dataset. using a special method and the required preprocessions are done on the data, then a simple network is trained. Finally, we can make the required predictions using the weights saved in the trained network.
